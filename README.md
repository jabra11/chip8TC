# Chip8TC
This project bundles a toolchain to generate machine code for a Chip-8 virtual machine like this one [chip8EMU](https://github.com/jabra98/chip8EMU).
It is planned to include a compiler (chipC), an assembler (chip8ASM) and a linker (chip8LD). None of these tools are close to being functional yet, you can see the progress on
them below.
